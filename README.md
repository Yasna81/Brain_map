## 🧠 Brain-Map : Mapping Brain Genome

🔗[Launch the app on ShinyApps.io](https://yossohani.shinyapps.io/brainmap/)


---
### ✴️ introduction :

**BrainMap** is a lightweigth, interactive Shiny application bulit to explore gene expresion across human brian tissues.The app is generated by RNA-seq data from the [GTEx Portal](https://www.gtexportal.org/home/downloads/adult-gtex/bulk_tissue_expression#:~:text=Additional%20GTEx%20datasets-,GTEx%20Analysis%20V10,-The%20GTEx%20Analysis)


Due to clinical relevance and frequent implication in neuropsychiatry and neurodegenrative disorders, this app was generated on 5 brain regions :
- Hypothalamus
- Amygdala
- frontal and anterior cortex
- hippocamus

These rejons are also centeral to neuroendocrine regulations, and could help researchers of the related fields.

- 1 : Upload your gene list (comma-seperated) , (more genes better plots :)).
- 2 : visualize tissue-specific expression patterns.
- 3 : view gene gene interaction heatmap.
- 4 : preform KEGG-based pathway enrihment (via 'clusterProfiler').
- 5 : get public databases link for selected genes.

### 🎯 Project Goals :


- Provide a foucesd tool for exploring gene epression in behaviorally relevant brain regions.
- Support hypothesis generation for the researchers in neuroscience, neuroendocrinology , genomics or transcriptomics.

#### 📷 Planned improvments :

- adding more brian tissues
- exporting results and sending directly to your inbox.
- using single cell data
- adding violin plots
